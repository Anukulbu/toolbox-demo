5.2 TODO: add link to the manual about long v wide formats

To add in toolbox-training: Motivation about CW_data_prep.Rmd - We have secchi depth to represent water clarity in summer. Goal: for each region, each year, one number: average summer secchi depth. but don't know in the raw data whether it's in the right format, we need to calcualte the averages.... -> add to training tutorial + demo 


How would you know to do all these steps? Maybe say something like "we're trying to understand water quality, and we have secchi depth, which is X. We'll want to only use it for specific region and depending on how the data is reported (months, years), we may have to summarize. 

Also, transitions between the toolbox-training and toolbox-demo when saving/registering data. 
-> reset: 

toolbox-training: add another screenshot of the secchi layer that you added

Add a chapter summary/recap
